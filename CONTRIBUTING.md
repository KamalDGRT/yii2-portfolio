Below you will find the process and workflow used to review and merge your changes.

### Step 0 : Find an issue

- Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your **own** Issues!
- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.
- Note : Every change in this project should/must have an associated issue.

### Step 1 : Fork the Project

- Fork this Repository. This will create a Local Copy of this Repository on your Github Profile.
- Keep a reference to the original project in `upstream` remote.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
cd <repo-name>
git remote add upstream https://github.com/<upstream-owner>/<repo-name>
```

- If you have already forked the project, update your copy before working.

```bash
git pull upstream main/master
```

### Step 2 : Setup the project in your PC

- Refer to [Setup.md](Setup.md) for instructions on setting up the project
- Make sure it is locally hosted in your system.

### Step 3 : Branch

Create a new branch. Use its name to identify the issue your addressing.

```bash
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to that branch
git checkout -b branch_name
```

### Step 4 : Work on the issue assigned

- Work on the issue(s) assigned to you.
- Add all the files/folders needed.
- After you've made changes or made your contribution to the project add changes to the branch you've just created by:

```bash
# To add all new files to branch Branch_Name
git add .

# To add only a few files to Branch_Name
git add <some files>
```

### Step 5 : Commit

- To commit give a descriptive message for the convenience of reviewer by:

```bash
# This message get associated with all files you have changed
git commit -m "message"
```

- **NOTE**: A PR should have only one commit. Multiple commits should be squashed.

### Step 6 : Work Remotely

- Now you are ready to your work to the remote repository.
- When your work is ready and complies with the project conventions, upload your changes to your fork:

```bash
# To push your work to your remote repository
git push origin Branch_Name
```

- Here is how your branch will look.

### Note : Do not add images, rather üëá

- We recently have removed all the images and screenshots from our repository and linked them to markdown files.

  #### How to do that?

  - You can do that by hosting all you images and screenshots to any images hosting sites such as [imgur](https://imgur.com/), [imgbb](https://imgbb.com/), [postimages](https://postimages.org/).
  - Then link your uploaded images to README files. An instance üëá
